©§ 7.1 OVERVIEW ©§
©»©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¿

	The input automaton, also known as user input automaton, is used for converting 
the  user's input  into the standard  internal representation  used by the system.  The 
conversion is done automatically, and the input automaton setting  is completed via the 
environment setup.  This chapter will explain how to setup the input automaton.

	We will now  give some  introduction on the  structure of cWnn  input automaton, 
as well as the setting of the automaton.

©»©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¿

	Figure 7.1  below shows the  brief structure of the input automaton.  The "Input" 
refers to the actual user input from the keyboard, and "Output" refers to the final input 
received by the system, after some initial processing in the input automaton.  

The mapping from  "Input" to  "Output" is performed by the input automaton.  However, the
mapping rules of the mapping process are defined in the  "Environment Settings".  Through  
environment settings, different types of input automaton mapping relationships can be 
defined.

During the  startup of a  front-end  processor,  the  initial environment setting of the 
input automaton is read from the default path.  After this, the user  may input with the 
help of this input automaton. There is a default input automaton environment in the cWnn 
system.  However, the user is able to set his individual input environment via the 
"Environment Setting". 

"Environment Setting" is done by using a simple language similar to "Lisp". 
This "Environment setting" is stored as source files in the system.  During the startup
of a front-end processor, it first reads in the "Environment Setting" files, and 
subsequently convert them to binary format used by the system.  The  characteristics of 
the input automaton is entirely dependent on the "Environment Setting".  Thus, from the 
user's viewpoint, the "Environmnet Setting" is the input automaton.

Examples of "Environment Setting" are given in Section 7.5.
We shall now describe the components of the input automaton and its settings.


1. Components of the Input Automaton
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
An input automaton consists of a  "mode definition table" and several "mapping tables", 
collectively known as the "conversion table".  

The  mode definition table  describes the  different input  modes and the relationship 
among them.  One input  mode provides  one input method at the cWnn user interface.  
Refer to Section 7.3 for details on mode definition table.

The mapping table describes the followings:
	    (1) Mapping relation from the "Input" to "Output" shown in Figure 7.1
	    (2)	Feedback input via the "Environment Setting" in Figures 7.1
	    (3) Operating  state of the  mode variables defined in the mode definition
	        table.

Figure 7.2  below  shows the  components of an  input automaton.  We  may see from the
figures that the  mapping table is  divided into  initial mapping table,  intermediate 
mapping table and  final mapping table.  Refer to Section 7.4  for details on  mapping
tables.

2. User Input Environment
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
(a) Phonetic input
	Through the settings in input automaton,  all Pinyin input may be standardized.
	That is, all user inputs  will first be processed in the automaton before they
	are passed to the system.  
	Each Pinyin is represented as a standard internal representation in the system.
	When a user input a Pinyin (external representation), it  will be converted to
	the internal  representation in  the automaton.  This internal code is used by
	the system.
	Hence regardless of any type of Pinyin input (Quanpin, Erpin or Sanpin, 
	together with the four tones), the system will always receive the standardized 
	internal form of Pinyin, which is treated as a single unit. 

(b) Encoded input
	Through the settings in the input automaton,  different types of encoded input  
	such as Wubi and Cangjie, may be set. 

	Other encoded input  such as internal code input, Quwei input, Guobiao as well 
	as other inputs of Hanzi are also possible.



3. Setting of Input Automaton
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
During  startup of front-end processor  "cuum", the input automaton setting file will 
be read.  The file will be searched in the following order:
(in descending priority)

(a) During startup, the "-r" option of "cuum" command is used.  Refer to Section 3.2.
    The path indicated together with this "-r" option is the specified path where all 
    the input automaton files are stored. The system will read in the input automaton 
    files from this directory, starting from the mode definition file "mode".

(b) If the above (a) is not used, the  path  specified by the command  "setrkfile" in 
    the  initialization  file  "uumrc"  will  be  read.  The  path  is the  specified 
    directory where all the input automaton files are stored. The system will read in 
    the input  automaton files from this directory, starting from the mode definition 
    file "mode".
 
(c) If (a) and (b) are not set or the file  does not  exist, the  respective default 
    file for the front-end processor "cuum" will be read.  
    The default input automaton files are as follow:

     /usr/local/lib/wnn/zh_CN/rk/mode    (for Combination of Pinyin and Zhuyin input 
					  environment)
     /usr/local/lib/wnn/zh_CN/rk_p/mode  (for Pinyin centred input environment)  
     /usr/local/lib/wnn/zh_CN/rk_z/mode  (for Zhuyin cwntred input environment)

©§ 7.3 MODE DEFINITION TABLE  ©§
©»©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¿

	The mode definition table  consists of the  mode variable definitions and the 
input mode expressions.  It describes the definition of the mode variables, the input
modes, as well as the relationship among the different input modes.  
The default filename of the mode definition table in cWnn is "mode" under the default 
directories:
"/usr/local/lib/wnn/zh_CN/rk"    (for Combination of Pinyin & Zhuyin input environment)
"/usr/local/lib/wnn/zh_CN/rk_p"  (for Pinyin centred input environment)
"/usr/local/lib/wnn/zh_CN/rk_z"  (for Zhuyin centred input environment)

The mode definition table is made up of the following three types of expressions:
(1) Search path of mapping table
(2) Mode variable definition
(3) Input mode expression


1. Search Path of Mapping Table 
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
The filename of the mapping table which appears in the mode definition table is assumed 
to have the  same path  as the mode definition table.  If the path is different, it can
be set in the mode definition table via the "search" command as follows:

  * Format
 	(search <pathname> ... ...)

    - <pathname> is the path of the mapping table.  
      Several pathnames may be set, each separated by a space.
    - This path must be specified before the mapping tables.


2. Mode Variable Definition 
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
The different mode variables are defined here.

  * Format
	(defmode  <mode_name>  <initial_state>)

    - <mode_name> is a defined name for each input mode.
      It begins with an alphabet, and may consist of numbers and alphabets.  The mode 
	variable may have two values: ON and OFF.
    - <initial_state> may be ON or OFF.  This indicates the initial state of the mode 
      variable.  Default state is OFF.
    - A mode variable must be defined before it can be used. 
 


					- 7-4 -
3. Input Mode Expression
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
The definition of the input mode can be done in the following three ways :
 
  * Format
  	<control_table> 
  	( if    condition  <mapping_table>  [<mapping_table>...]  <mode_indicator> )
  	( when  condition  <mapping_table>  [<mapping_table>...]  <mode_indicator> ) 

    - <control_table> is a  special mapping table that allows the user to  switch among 
      the input modes.
    - <mapping_table> are the mapping files for each input mode. In the mode definition 
      table, the identifying file for the initial mapping tables begin with a "1".  For
      example, 1B_BS, 1B_TOLOWER and 1B_TOUPPER.
      Intermediate mapping tables begin with a  "2" and final mapping tables begin with 
      a "3".  For example,  2P_RongCuo, 2Z_tail_ma and 3B_quanjiao.
      Several mapping  tables are allowed by they  must follow the sequence of initial,
      intermediate and final.
    - The <mode_indicator>  can be represented by a string of characters quoted in " ", 
      to indicate the current input mode to the user.  If there are more than one mode 
      indicator in the mode expression, only the last indicator is valid.
    - Both  "if" and  "when" are conditional  statements, with some differences between 
      them.  For  "if" statements, if the condition is ture, the  remaining part of the 
      "if" statement  will be evaluated,  and the next statement will not be evaluated.  
      If the condition is false, leave the current "if" statement and proceed to 
      evaluate the next statement.
    - For "when" statements, if the condition is true, the remaining part of the "when"
      statement will be evaluated;  otherwise the remaining part will not be evaluated. 
      In any case, the next statement after the "when" statement will be evaluated.
      the condition definition will be explained in details below:

      Condition Definition 
      ©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
      The "condition" above can be expressed in the following ways :

    ©°©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©Ð©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©´

     The following is an example of input mode expression.  
     ¡ð ¡ò ¡ñ represent conditions, and A B C D E represent conversion table.  
     Assume that the ¡ð ¡ò ¡ñ conditions as true in this example.

       Example
       ©¤©¤©¤©¤
   	   (when ¡ð A (if ¡ò  B) C)  (if ¡ñ  D)  E

       Reading from left to right, we first consider (when ¡ð  A (if ¡ò B) C).  
       Since ¡ð is true, we proceed to A (if ¡ò B) C.  First select A , then (if ¡ò B). 
       Since ¡ò is true, B is selected.  As the condition is true for "if", the 
       remaining statement of A (if ¡ò B) C will not be processed. 

       Since (when ¡ð A (if ¡ò  B) C) is a subset of 
       (when ¡ð A (if ¡ò  B) C)  (if ¡ñ  D)  E , the rest of the statement must be 
       processed.

       Lastly for (if ¡ñ  D), as ¡ñ is true, D is selected.  Furthermore, the statement 
       is an "if" statement, hence the rest of the statement
       (when ¡ð A (if ¡ò  B) C)  (if ¡ñ  D)  E  need not be processed.  As a result, 
       A, B and D are selected after the execution of this statement.

©§ 7.4 MAPPING TABLES ©§
©»©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¿
 
	In any input mode, the relation between the  "Input" and "Output" of the input 
automaton (as in Figure 7.1) is represented in the mapping tables.  The mapping tables 
consist  of the initial, intermediate and final  mapping tables.  Refer to Figure 7.3.
In the whole process, the  intermediate mapping  plays the main role, with the initial 
and final mapping acting as the preparation and touching up respectively. 

	During the input automaton mapping process, the input characters first undergo
the initial mapping as shown in  Figures 7.3.  The result (output-1) is then passed to 
the intermediate mapping table as input to undergo a character string mapping. 
Subsequently,  output-2  is  passed as input for final mapping.  Output-3 is the final 
output of the input automaton.  
The feedback shown in diagram is treated as input to the intermediate mapping.

	The initial mapping can only perform mapping between characters.  For example,
to map an  "e"  to an  "E" as in Figure 7.3.  Intermediate mapping is able to perform 
 mapping between  character strings.  For example, mapping from  "EU" to "Eu".  Final 
mapping can perform  mappings from character and character string.  For example, from
"I" maps to "Ch" during Erpin input.
Besides, feedback  input can also be provided by the intermediate mapping. 

We will now describe the variable definitions in each of the mapping tables.









					- 7-7 -
1. Variable Definition 
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
Through  definitions and  the use of  variables,  similar mapping relations can be
described easily and effectively.  

In the mapping tables, each process table has its own format of definitions: 

    (a) Initial mapping table 
    ©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤©¤
     In the initial mapping table, the definitions consists of the followings:
     - Format 
    	     (defvar  <variable_name>  (list  <character>  ...  ...))     -----(a)
   	     (defvar  <variable_name>  (all))			          -----(b)
	     <variable_name>	  [<variable_representation>]

	 Either (a) or (b) may be used.
	 In (a), <variable_name> can be any of the characters in "list".  
	 In (b), the <variable_name> can be any character.  

     - Format Pattern Description
         The format has the following pattern:
     	     Character_Variable_Definition
	     Input_Character_Representation   [Output_Character_Representation]

         If the user input character matches the character in "Input_Character_
         Representation", the input automaton converts it to the character in 
         "Output_Character_Representation".

         (a) and (b) above are the two types of Character_Variable_Definition.  
         The example below show the similar conversion relations. 

     - Example 
	 eg1 :  (defvar   bs    (list '\x08'))
	   	(bs)      R

	 eg2 : 	(defvar	  up    (all))
		(up)   	  (tozenhira (tolower(up)))

     In the intermediate mapping table, the definitions consists of the followings:
     - Format 
    	     (defvar  <variable_name>  (list  <character>  ...  ...))     -----(a)
   	     (defvar  <variable_name>  (all))			          -----(b)
	     <input_variable>  [<output_variable>]  [<feedback_variable>]
	     <variable_condition>      <operation>

	 Either (a) or (b) may be used.  In (a), <variable_name> can be any of the 
	 characters in "list".  In (b), the <variable_name> can be any character.  
	
     - Format Pattern Description
         The format above has the following pattern:
  	     Character_Variable_Definition
  	     Input_Character_String_Representation  [Output_Character_String_Representation] 
 	           [Feedback_Character_String_Representation] 			      ---(*)
	     Input_Character_String_Representation   Operation		      	      ---(@)

	 In (*), if the  input character  string  matches  the character string in
	 "Input_Character_String_Representation",  the input automaton converts it 
	 to the character string in "Output_Character_String_Representation".
	 During  output, the  "Feedback_Character_String_Representation"  will  be 
	 treated as new input to intermediate mapping.

	 In (@), if the input character matches the character in 
	 "Input_Character_String_Representation", the input automaton performs the 
	 specified operation on the mode variables.

     - Example
	 eg1 :	(defvar   A     (list  B C D) )
	 	(A)A      (A)aŽÀ

	 eg2 : 	(defvar   str   (list  0 1 2 3 4 5 \

     In the final mapping table, the definitions consists of the followings:
     - Format 
    	     (defvar  <variable_name>  (list  <character>  ...  ...))     -----(a)
   	     (defvar  <variable_name>  (all))			          -----(b)
	     <variable_name>	  [<variable_representation>]

	 Either (a) or (b) may be used.  In (a), <variable_name> can be any of the 
	 characters in "list".  In (b), the <variable_name> can be any character.  
	
     - Format Pattern Description
         The format above has the following pattern:
  	     Character_Variable_Definition
  	     input_Character_Representation  [Output_Character_String_Representation]

	 If the input character matches the character in "Input_Character_Representation", 
	 the input automaton converts it to the character string in 
	 "Output_Character_String_Representation".
 
     - Example
	 eg1 :	(defvar a (all))
		(a)     (tozenalpha (a))


NOTE:	
  - In the parts in [ ] of the above "Format Pattern Description" are options.
  - One expression should be in the same line.  If there is not enough space for 
    the expression, it can be continued on the following line by using the \.
  - Anything after a semicolon ";" in a line is treated as comment. 


SUPPLEMENT:
  During the definition and use of variables,
  (a) The variable must be defined before it is used. 
  (b) The variable definitions are only valid in the current mapping table, and not
      in other tables.
  (c) Variables in the same line have the same value.  For example:

		(defvar a1 (list A B))
		(a1) (tolower(a1))  3

	When input  [Aa] or [Bb], the result will be 3.  However, there is no match 
	when input is [Ab] or [Ba].

©§ 7.5  AN EXAMPLE OF INPUT AUTOMATON ©§
©»©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¿
 
	We have introduced the input automaton in the above Sections.  We will now 
give an example of a simple input automaton, using the front-end processor "cuum". 
Take note that  some of the definitions are DIFFERENT from the standard definition
in  cWnn.  For example, the  encoded input  definitions are  not  included in this
sample input automaton.

	The mode definition table and the mode control table will be shown.  
However, only  some of the mapping tables are shown.  Users  who are interested in 
the input automaton can refer directly to the files under the default path.

1. Mode Definition Table (mode)
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
This is the "mode definition table" we have described in Section 7.3.  It consists 
of the relationship between the mode variables and the input mode.

* Default Path
	/usr/local/lib/wnn/zh_CN/rk/mode

* Content

       	     (if ban_jiao            "°ë½Ç:")
             (if quan_jiao           3B_quanjiao    "È«½Ç:")
	)
 












					- 7-15 -
* Description
	The above mode definition table defines the "Pinyin" , "Banjiao" character 
	and "Quanjiao" input modes.  

	Initially  ©¤ YIN mode is set to ON 
		   ©¤ PY mode under YIN is set to ON 
		   ©¤ ZY is set to OFF
		   ©¤ ASCII mode is set to OFF
		   ©¤ ban_jiao mode under ASCII is set to ON
		   ©¤ quan_jiao mode under ASCII is set to OFF

	From the above ASCII definitions in the mode definition table, during the 
	initial state, the input  automaton receives  Banjiao input.  Notice that 
	the ban_jiao state under the ASCII state has no mapping table, this means 
	that the user input is received directly by the system.  

	For the YIN definition, to input Pinyin, user needs to change the mode to 
	PY (under YIN).  The way of changing the  mode is  defined in the mapping 
	table 2A_CTRL (see next paragraph).  Here, we assume that  we are already 
	in the PY mode, and the input automaton receives Pinyin input.
	The automaton will first follow the definition of mapping table 1B_TOUPPER 
	to convert the actual user input to upper case alphabets.  Subsequently, 
	the automaton creates the "actual final input received by the system" 
	based on mapping tables 2P_QuanPin, 2P_RongCuo and 2Z_tail_pin.
	We will now show a simple example:

	      -	When a user inputs  "Zhong", or  "ZHONG", according to the 
		definitions in 2P_QuanPin, the input automaton outputs "ZhongŽÀ".  

	      -	When a user inputs  "JA" by mistake, the automaton automatically 
		corrects this error to "Jia" based on the definitions in mapping 
		table 2P_RongCuo. 

	      -	As for punctuations, in mapping table 2Z_tail_pin, mapping 
		relation between ASCII  "." and  Chinese "¡£" is defined.  
		Hence, when user enters an ASCII ".", the automaton outputs the 
		Chinese "¡£".

	Similarly, the user is  able to change the mode to Wubi mode to input Hanzi, 
	or change to Quanjiao mode to input wide ASCII characters.

	NOTE:   Wubi mode is not described in this example. However, the definitions
		are similar.  Refer to the system standard files for examples.

©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
This is the <control_table> in the "Input Mode Expression" mentioned in Section 7.3.  
It controls the  mode variables and allows the user to switch among different input 
modes.

2A_CTRL  is  referred in the  initialization file  "mode".  The key code defined in
"uumkey" is used in this table.
