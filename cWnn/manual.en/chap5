   5.2  cserverrc - THE INITIALIZATION FILE OF THE SERVER   
   ======================================================
   
 * Description 
	cserverrc  -  Server initialization file

 * Standard path 
	/usr/local/lib/wnn/zh_CN/cserverrc

 * Function 
	During  the  startup  of cserver,  cserverrc is read  as well as  all the files 
	defined in cserverrc (dictionaries and grammar files).

 * Definition 
  	1. Dictionaries that are read during the startup of cserver
  	   - Format
	     readfile  <wnn_file> 
	     Read in wnn_file.  All dictionaries and grammar files (refer Chapter 7 for 
	     details)  are  read  in  during  cserver  startup  and maintained until the 
	     termination of cserver.

  	2. Maximum client allowed
  	   - Format
	     max_client  n
	     This is  the  maximum  number  of  clients (users) that  are allowed  to be 
	     connected at any one time.  Default value is 32.

  	3. Maximum environment
  	   - Format
	     max_sticky_env  n
	     This is the maximum number of permanent environment allowed.  
	     A permanent  environment remains in the server after the termination of the 
	     front-end uum. This helps in  reducing the startup time of each client and 
	     repeated operations.  Default value is 10.

  	4. Path of dictionaries that are maintained by the server.
  	   - Format
	     jserverdir  <path>
	     This defines the path of dictionaries maintained by the server.
	     Usage frequency files and dictionaries of the user are also maintained here. 
	     The default path is "/usr/local/lib/wnn/zh_CN/".

			<parameter 15>  <parameter 16> 

	     All parameters are integers. 
	     During  conversion, server will perform the conversion evaluation based on 
	     these parameter values. 

		   <parameter 0>  : number of phrase "n" to be assesed
		   <parameter 1>  : number of words "m" in phrase
		   <parameter 2>  : usage frequency weight

   5.3  uumrc - THE INITIALIZATION FILE OF THE CLIENT (uum)   
   ==========================================================
  
 * Description 
	uumrc  -  Client (cuum) initialization file.

 * Standard paths
	/usr/local/lib/wnn/zh_CN/uumrc 

 * Function 
	Initialization file for the startup of the client. 
  	- Set the path of  each of the environment setup files, the keyboard layout file 
	  etc.
  	- Set the initial state after startup of client.
  	- Set the different conversion parameters.

 * Content 
  	- include
  	   > Format
	     include  <path> 
	     Read in all the initialization files defined in <path>. 
	     Used when user needs to add his own definitions.

	     specified  hostname.  Similarly, the server will  be that  of the specified 
	     host. 
	     [sticky] implies a permanent environment.
	     <env_type> indicates the environment type.  The types include Pinyin/Zhuyin 
	     input and the Bianma input environment.
	     Pinyin/Zhuyin  input environment  is represented by "PZ".  The Bianma input

 * Note
	When the conversion state is OFF, the front-end processor will be temporary
	disconnected. Therefore, the input automaton also stops functioning.
	A key code refers to a code between  0 and 255.  However, not all codes can 
	be  entered  from  the keyboard.  To  input  a code that  cannot be entered 
	directly via the keyboard, use key code conversion (Refer to 5.7)  or input 
	automaton (Refer to chapter 6).

 * Description 
	cvt_key_tbl  -  The key code conversion table for the front-end processor.

 * Standard path 
	/usr/local/lib/wnn/cvt_key_tbl 

 * Function 
	To differentiate  the character  code of the  keyboard from terminfo, and 
	convert them to single characters according to the function.

 * Format 
	[terminfo entry <space>  code]  (Unios-U)
	[termcap  entry <space>  code]  (Unios-B)
